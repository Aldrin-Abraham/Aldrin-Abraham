- 👀 I’m interested in innovative technology development, with a focus on advanced programming and solving complex problems through creative coding.  
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Python, C, and Java, deepening my understanding of these languages and their applications.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that leverage these languages, spanning areas that go beyond standard computing into unique, real-world applications.  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a curiosity for fusion energy and sustainable technologies—I'm fascinated by their potential to shape the future, even if they’re more of a side interest.
- 🧠 Most of the projects here are born from my original ideas, where I focus on envisioning unique solutions and mapping out creative problem-solving approaches.
- 🤖 While I actively direct the project goals, design, and architecture, much of the hands-on implementation is supported by AI tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, which I use to accelerate and refine development.
- 📌 I believe in working smart—leveraging modern tools to transform concepts into reality faster, while staying deeply involved in the logic, flow, and adaptability of each project.
